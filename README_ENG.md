# black Jack

**Description**

Among all online games, Blackjack is the most interesting and exciting. The basic rules of Blackjack reflect its difference from slots or roulette, because it requires luck as well as skills, whereas slot and roulette games are entirely dependent on luck. The card game Blackjack trains memory, entertains, and provides useful and enjoyable leisure. This game is significantly simpler than poker and chess, so starting to play our game is very easy. **This project was worked on by a team, and my part involved performing C++ functions.**
